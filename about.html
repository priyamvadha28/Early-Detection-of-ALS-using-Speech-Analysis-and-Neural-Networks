    <h1>About ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)</h1>
    <p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It leads to muscle weakness, atrophy, and eventually paralysis. ALS affects voluntary muscle control and causes severe impairment in daily activities, including speaking, swallowing, and breathing.</p>
    
    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Muscle twitching and cramping</li>
        <li>Muscle weakness, especially in the limbs</li>
        <li>Slurred speech and difficulty swallowing</li>
        <li>Difficulty breathing due to muscle weakness</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Treatment:</h2>
    <p>There is no cure for ALS, but treatments focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Medications like Riluzole and Edaravone may slow the disease's progression slightly, while therapies like physical, speech, and occupational therapy help with daily functioning.</p>
